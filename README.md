# cpp-interview1

## 1. Implement a main function in main.cpp that can compile and run on from command line.  

Have the following Edges read in from the command line for creating an undirected graph:  

1, 2   
1, 3  
2, 4  
3, 4  
3, 5  
4, 5  
4, 6  

## 2. Create a function that prints the Graph so the output uses the following format 

1->2  
  
2->1  
2->3  

## 3. Use the BFS to create a directed Graph and print the Edges and the Graph.
